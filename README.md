# About



LinkedIn’s analytics can help you track progress, measure success, and connect with your target audience.

The LinkedIn algorithm(People You Know, Talking About Things You Care About) ultimately determines what content is prioritized in your LinkedIn feed, as well as the amount of reach your content receives in the feeds of others.<br>

By default, your LinkedIn feed is sorted by “Top Updates.” These posts are populated based on your activity (think: accounts you regularly interact with via “Likes,” shares and comments). <br>

Reach is rewarded to accounts that score frequent interactions and engagement.

Unlike twitter, The algorithm (allegedly) does not favor a particular post format (think: text, images, video and so on)

Top on the list of a post performing well is 'posts that encourage conversation'
